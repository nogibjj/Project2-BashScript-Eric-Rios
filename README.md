# Project 2 : Bash Script to extract useful data from a dataset 
This is a project where the objective is to handle a dataset and do some basic processing on it via the use of a Bash script. There are two scripts for this videogame dataset. One allows the user to see the top 10 selling titles of all time. The other permits the user to find all the titles created under their favorite publishe, as well as their overall publishing count. Both scripts will output a custom csv file.

## Purpose
The industry players compete aggresively every year to sell the most titles. It would be ideal to have a bash script that processes these generic datasets on a yearly or even quarterly basis. There is no need to spend much time filtering multiple csv files, and the script for "top 10" can easily be modified to expand to 20 entries or more.
